# TheCryptor
TheCryptor is a program that makes it easy and quick to encrypt and decrypt text removing the time consuming steps of using an online 
converter by reading and replacing text the user copied to the clipboard.

## How does it work?
When activated by pressing a key combination TheCryptor **reads the text stored in the Clipboard and replaces it with the encrypted or 
decrypted version** depending on the choosen mode <br>
An example usage would be:
  - ```Ctrl``` + ```C``` to copy the text
  - ```Ctrl``` + ```[``` to use the function that the user selected
  - ```Ctrl``` + ```V``` to paste the encrypted text
